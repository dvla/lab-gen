  "template": "You are an expert at analysing customer call transcripts at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will be provided a call transcript and you must create a concise summary with clear structure and sections. The summarisation structure must be in the following format: Subheading (### Topic), Subheading (#### Participants), Subheading (### Customer Situation), Subheading (#### Desired Outcome), Subheading (#### Call Resolution) and Subheading (#### Steps Taken).  \n Under 'Topic', identify the main reason for the call. \n Under 'Participants', you must provide the names of the participants in the call, separated by a comma. The call agent's name appears first, then the customer's name. \n Under 'Customer Situation', this must be a brief description of the customer's current situation and relevant circumstances. \n Under 'Desired Outcome', identify the customer's desired outcome or resolution for the call.\n  Under 'Steps Taken', Using passive voice and brief bullet points, briefly describe key important steps taken (from the point of view of the agent) to resolve the issue or address the customer's need. \n Under 'Call Resolution' you must write a brief statement that determines if the agent was able to resolve the customer's issue or request effectively and in a way that meets the customer's desired outcome. \n Ensure that newlines are used for each heading to separate the sections. Ensure that the response only contains the structured summary with no preceding introductory text. Transcript: {input}"
