# DVLA Emerging Tech Lab Generative AI

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- `pipx install uv`
- `uv sync`

### Quick Start

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dvla/lab-gen)

[![Open in VS Code Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/dvla/lab-gen)

To run the project use this set of commands:

Setup the `.env` file:
```bash
cp example.env .env
echo 'LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_URI=https://my-store.documents.azure.com:443/'  >> .env
echo 'LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_KEY=0177PWaDjWhceFttEK4Q=='  >> .env
```

Setup your models config:

 `cp -r example_secrets secrets`.

 Edit the `AZURE_MODELS` file in `./secrets`.

Run the application:
```bash
uv run python -m lab_gen
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

A simple test request is:
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/conversations' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-business-user: king.kong' \
  -H 'Authorization: 1234' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "content": "What is the DVLA?"
}'
```

## Project structure

```bash
$ tree "lab_gen"
lab_gen
├── conftest.py  # Fixtures for all tests.
├── __main__.py  # Startup script. Starts uvicorn.
├── services  # Package for different external services such as openai or cosmosdb etc.
├── settings.py  # Main configuration settings for project.
├── static  # Static content.
├── tests  # Tests for project.
└── web  # Package contains web server. Handlers, startup config.
    ├── api  # Package with all handlers.
    │   └── router.py  # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifetime.py  # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "LAB_GEN_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "lab_gen/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "LAB_GEN_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `lab_gen.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
LAB_GEN_RELOAD="True"
LAB_GEN_PORT="8000"
LAB_GEN_ENVIRONMENT="myname"
LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_URI=https://my-store.documents.azure.com:443/
LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_KEY=0177PWaDjWhceFttEK4Q==
LAB_GEN_SESSION_STORE_TTL=172800
AZURE_APP_API_KEY=1234
AZURE_MODELS=[{"provider": "AZURE","variant": "GENERAL","identifier": "gpt-35-1106","description": "OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo powered","location":"UK"},{"provider": "AZURE","variant": "ADVANCED","identifier": "gpt-4-1106","description": "OpenAI GPT-4","location":"UK"}]
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING="InstrumentationKey=99x99999-9xxx-9999-x9x9-9999999x999x;IngestionEndpoint=https://example.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/;LiveEndpoint=https://example.livediagnostics.monitor.azure.com/"
LOGURU_LEVEL="INFO"
TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR=tiktoken_cache
```

### Model config
The model configuration is a json list and can be specified in any of the following ways:
1. If an `APPCONFIGURATION_CONNECTION_STRING` is specifed then any variables starting with `AZURE` are looked up in Azure App Config.
    e.g. `AZURE_MODELS`.
2. `AZURE_MODELS` can be specified as an enviroment variable on a single line (see example above).
3. A `secrets` folder can be used to set values.  For example, rename the `example_secrets` folder to just `secrets` and the `AZURE_MODELS` file will be used for the model configuration.

### AWS Guardrails

AWS Guardrails can be configured on the Bedrock models by adding the 'guardrailId' and 'guardrailversion' to the config.

An example of a Bedrock config with Guardrails configured:
```bash
["provider": "BEDROCK",
"variant": "ADVANCED",
"family": "CLAUDE",
"identifier": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet",
"description": "Claude 3 Sonnet",
"location": "Paris",
"config":{"AWS_REGION": "eu-west-3",
          "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "xxxxx",
          "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "xxxxx",
          "guardrailIdentifier": "ejgbdBFg5TD",
          "guardrailVersion": "DRAFT"}]
```

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

You can read more about pre-commit here: https://pre-commit.com/

## Running tests

For running tests on your local machine.


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
uv run pytest -vv
```

## Langfuse

Langfuse tracks traces of LLM calls. Traces can be view at [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com). You need to add the following to ```.env```.

```bash
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="secret-key" # available from langfuse cloud Settings
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="public-key" # available from langfuse cloud Settings
LANGFUSE_HOST="langfuse host url" # available from langfuse cloud Settings
```
